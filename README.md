##A simple python base web crawler

I saw a lot of python based web-crawlers online, some as short as 12 lines. So I thought I would give it a go as well. I recently got into python and am still in learning phase. I am not, however, new to programming as I have done Java and C++ in the past. I am just so amazed with the readability of Python. While there are times where i wish that Python would forgive an accidental ';' at the end of a line, it is still not a major turn off.

Anyway, back to pycrawler.
